// envelopeWriteTimeout caps how long a single binary-envelope forward to
// the destination peer can take before being abandoned. Mirrors
// broadcastWriteTimeout in spirit — a slow recipient must not park the
// sender's read loop indefinitely. Reusing the same constant keeps the
// "max time the relay tolerates a slow peer" invariant uniform across
// the discovery, friendship, and envelope-routing paths.

// forwardEnvelope parses a binary envelope frame from sender, looks up
// the destination identity, verifies the (sender, recipient) friendship
// is established, rewrites the peer field destination -> source, and
// forwards the frame to the destination peer. All failure modes
// (malformed frame, missing destination, no friendship, write error)
// drop the frame silently — the relay never replies inline to envelope
// frames per AGENTS.md "What the Relay Enforces".
//
// The frame buffer comes from coder/websocket's Read and is valid only
// until the caller's next Read on the same conn — this function
// completes the synchronous forward (including the Write to the
// destination) before returning, so the caller can immediately Read the
// next frame without copying.
//
// Synchronous-write trade-off: a slow recipient's Write blocks the
// sender's read loop for up to envelopeWriteTimeout. That's acceptable
// for v0 because the bound is tight and the alternative (per-forward
// goroutine + frame copy) is more code with no real-world win on a LAN.
// If we ever multiplex many concurrent transfers per pair, revisit.
