# syntax=docker/dockerfile:1.7
#
# Multi-stage Dockerfile for LemurPouch.
#
#   Stage 1 (web-build):  Node compiles the React bundle to web/dist/.
#   Stage 2 (go-build):   Go cross-compiles the relay binary; the
#                         //go:embed directive in main.go bakes in
#                         the dist/ from stage 1.
#   Stage 3 (runtime):    distroless/static — ~2 MB base, no shell,
#                         no package manager, runs as nonroot.
#
# Final image is ~10–15 MB compressed across both archs.

# ---- Stage 1: build the React bundle -----------------------------------
#
# --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM forces this stage to run natively on the
# build host even when the target platform differs (the JS output is
# platform-independent so there is no point running it under qemu).

FROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM node:24-alpine AS web-build
WORKDIR /src/web

# Copy lockfile + manifest first so the install layer is cached when
# only source files change.
COPY web/package.json web/package-lock.json ./
RUN npm ci

COPY web/ ./
RUN npm run build


# ---- Stage 2: build the Go binary --------------------------------------
#
# --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM keeps the toolchain on the native host;
# Go's GOOS/GOARCH does the cross-compile so we don't pay qemu cost.

FROM --platform=$BUILDPLATFORM golang:1.25-alpine AS go-build
WORKDIR /src

COPY go.mod go.sum ./
RUN go mod download

COPY . .
# Drop the build-host's web/dist (a .gitkeep stub) and substitute the
# dist/ produced in stage 1, so the //go:embed picks up the real bundle.

# need to USER it explicitly because the tag doesn't set it.

# Tell the binary it's running inside the LemurPouch container image.
# main.go reads this on startup and appends a note to the
# URL-enumeration block clarifying that the listed interface IPs are
# container-internal (bridge addresses, not host LAN). We use a
# project-specific ENV instead of probing /.dockerenv so the hint
# only fires for OUR image — a user `docker cp`-ing the binary out
# and running it bare on the host won't see the in-container note.
